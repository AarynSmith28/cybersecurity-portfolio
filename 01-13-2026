## 1. Access Control Models

| Model | Description | Key Concept |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** | Grants access based on a user’s role | Who you are |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** | Grants access based on attributes & policies (role, time, location, etc.) | Context + details |
| **Rule-Based Access Control** | Grants or denies access based on IF-THEN rules | Conditional logic |
| **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** | Resource owner decides who gets access | Owner-controlled |
| **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** | Access controlled by strict rules set by an authority | Authority-controlled |

**Key Takeaway:** Access control determines **who can access what, when, and under what conditions**, preventing breaches and protecting sensitive data.

## 2. Access Control Tools & Concepts

- **Access Control List (ACL):** Specifies **permit or deny** rules for subjects accessing objects.  
- **Discretionary vs Non-Discretionary:**  
  - Discretionary: Owner-controlled (e.g., sharing a file)  
  - Non-Discretionary: System-controlled (e.g., RBAC, MAC)

## 3. Authentication vs Authorization

| Concept | Definition | Examples |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Identity** | A claim of who you are | Username, email |
| **Authentication** | Proving identity | Something you know (password), have (token), are (biometrics), or somewhere you are (location) |
| **Authorization** | Determining rights & permissions | Read/write access, admin rights |

## 4. Common Authentication Services

| Service | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **RADIUS** | Centralized network authentication |
| **TACACS+** | AAA protocol for device administration |
| **Kerberos** | Ticket-based authentication (SSO, local networks) |
| **LDAP** | Directory services based on X.500 standard |
| **Active Directory** | Microsoft directory service for identity management |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)** | One login for multiple systems |

---

## 5. Summary

- **RBAC:** Who you are → Role determines access  
- **ABAC:** Context matters → Attributes + policies  
- **Rule-Based:** IF-THEN conditions control access  
- **DAC vs MAC:** Owner-controlled vs Authority-controlled  
- **Authentication:** Prove identity  
- **Authorization:** Determine what actions are allowed  

> These models and services together ensure secure, controlled, and auditable access across systems and networks.
