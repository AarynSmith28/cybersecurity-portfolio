# Cybersecurity Access & Authentication

---

## 1. Federation & Identity Management

Federation allows **separate organizations to trust each other**, letting users log in once and access systems across multiple domains.  

### Key Components

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Principal** | The user or entity trying to access a resource | You, as the user |
| **Identity Provider (IdP)** | Verifies identity and issues credentials | Google, corporate login |
| **Service Provider (SP)** | Trusts the IdP and provides access | Zoom, AWS, a SaaS app |

**Flow:**  
1. Principal proves identity to IdP  
2. IdP issues proof of identity  
3. SP trusts IdP and grants access

## 2. Federation Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** | Single Sign-On (SSO) in federated environments | XML-based, widely used in corporate SSO |
| **Kerberos** | Local network authentication | Ticket-based system for land-based networks |
| **OAuth** | Allows apps to access user resources without passwords | Ideal for third-party app integrations |
| **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** | Extends OAuth with authentication and identity | Secure login using external accounts (Google, Microsoft) |

**Key Takeaway:** Choosing the right protocol balances **security, usability, and compliance** across systems.

## 3. Access Methods & Agents

| Concept | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Passive vs Active** | Passive monitors without interaction; Active can interact with the network |
| **Agent vs Agentless** | Agent requires software on the device; Agentless queries devices remotely |
| **Credential vs Credential-less** | Credential-based uses passwords/tokens; Credential-less uses certificate or device authentication |

## 4. Network Monitoring & Traffic

| Tool | Description |
|------|------------|
| **TAP (Test Access Point)** | Captures **all traffic** on a network segment |
| **SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer)** | Mirrors traffic from one port to another for analysis |

**Tip:** TAPs are passive and do not impact network traffic; SPAN ports can affect switch performance.

## 5. Firewalls & Packet Filtering

| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Packet Filtering** | Basic firewall filtering packets based on IP, port, protocol |
| **Stateless** | Treats each packet independently; does not track session state |
| **Stateful** | Tracks connection state; makes context-aware decisions |

---

## 6. Summary

- **Federation:** Users can log in once and access multiple systems securely.  
- **Protocols:** SAML, OAuth, OIDC, Kerberos each serve different authentication/authorization needs.  
- **Access Methods:** Passive/active, agent/agentless, credentialed/credential-less approaches.  
- **Network Monitoring:** TAP and SPAN enable traffic capture for security analysis.  
- **Firewalls:** Stateless vs stateful packet filtering for network protection.
