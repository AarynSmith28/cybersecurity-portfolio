## 1. SSH vs TLS

| Feature        | SSH (Secure Shell)                 | TLS (Transport Layer Security)        |
|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Remote access to systems          | Secure browser/server communication |
| **Encryption** | Asymmetric (public/private keys) | Asymmetric (public/private keys)    |
| **Security**   | Authentication & confidentiality  | Encryption & integrity               |
| **Typical Use**| Logging into servers, remote management | HTTPS websites, secure data transmission |

Both rely on asymmetric encryption. SSH is for system management; TLS protects web traffic.


## 2. Subjects vs Objects

- **Subject:** The active entity (user, group, or process) requesting access.  
- **Object:** Any resource or asset being accessed (file, database, application).

**Example:**  
A user (subject) reads a confidential file (object).


## 3. Permissions vs Rights

| Concept      | Definition                               | Example                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Permissions** | Control the ability to read, write, or execute a resource | File ACL allowing read/write for a user    |
| **Rights**      | Allow a subject to perform specific system-level actions | Ability to shut down a computer or install software |

 Permissions are resource-specific; rights are broader system-level privileges.


## 4. Explicit vs Implicit Access

- **Explicit:** Directly granted permissions.  
- **Implicit:** Inferred or assumed permissions (e.g., via group membership or defaults).

**Example:**  
- Explicit: User “Alice” has read access to File A.  
- Implicit: User “Alice” is in group “Staff” that has read access to File A.
