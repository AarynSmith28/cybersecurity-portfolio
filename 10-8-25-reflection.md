What I Learned: Today, I learned how to set up GitHub and create reflection entries with guidance from J.W. I also deepened my understanding of the OSI model and explored the different network topologies used in various infrastructures.
Challenges Faced: I encountered some challenges during the lab exercises, particularly when connecting the router and access point. However, through persistence and troubleshooting, I was able to resolve the issues and successfully complete the setup.
How I Learned: Collaboration played a big role in my learning today. By working closely with classmates and brainstorming solutions together, we identified what each of us had missed and strengthened our overall understanding of the material.
Next Steps: Moving forward, I plan to watch tutorials on network concepts and SOHO routers to reinforce what I’ve learned and continue improving my networking skills. My goal is to gain a deeper technical foundation that supports my growth in IT and cybersecurity.
