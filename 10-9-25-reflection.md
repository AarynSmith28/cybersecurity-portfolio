What I Learned: Today, we took a deep dive into the Physical Layer and Data Link Layer of the OSI model with Mr. Daryl. I gained a clearer understanding of how data is transmitted across networks and the important roles that different networking devices play in maintaining signal quality and connectivity.
Challenges Faced: One of the main challenges I faced was differentiating the roles of similar devices, such as repeaters, hubs, and switches. At first, it was difficult to visualize how they operate at different OSI layers and impact network performance. I also ran into trouble understanding signal degradation and how distance can affect transmission quality, especially when connecting different types of cables. To overcome these challenges, I asked clarifying questions, revisited the lab materials, and reviewed diagrams that illustrated how data moves between layers.
How I Learned: I learned by actively engaging in discussions with Mr. Daryl and my classmates. Collaborating during the lesson helped me fill in the gaps in my understanding. I also took notes and compared examples of network setups to reinforce how each component functions in real-world scenarios.
Next Steps: Next, I plan to watch video demonstrations on the Physical and Data Link Layers to strengthen my visual understanding of how signals travel. I also want to experiment with Packet Tracer or a similar simulator to apply these concepts hands-on.
