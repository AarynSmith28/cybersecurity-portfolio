#Nmap Cheat Sheet for Cybersecurity

## 1. Common Nmap Scan Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-F`             | Scan only the top 100 most popular ports                         |
| `-sS`            | SYN scan (default, reliable scan type)                           |
| `-sV`            | Version scan to identify services on open ports                  |
| `-O`             | Attempt to detect the operating system                           |
| `-Pn`            | Disable host discovery; assumes all hosts are up                 |
| `-oN <filename>` | Save output to a file in normal format (also displays on screen) |

**Example Nmap Command:**

```bash
nmap -F -sS -sV -O -Pn -oN border-scan.nmap 192.168.1.1
```

This command scans the top 100 ports of the target, identifies open ports, versions, OS, and saves the output to `border-scan.nmap`.

## 2. Viewing Scan Results

| Command                      | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `grep open border-scan.nmap` | View only open ports from the saved scan file         |
| `grep OS border-scan.nmap`   | Display OS detection results from the saved scan file |

**Example:**

```bash
grep open border-scan.nmap
grep OS border-scan.nmap
```

> Tip: Combining these parameters allows you to perform **quick, efficient, and detailed reconnaissance** on network targets, essential for cybersecurity assessments and penetration testing.
