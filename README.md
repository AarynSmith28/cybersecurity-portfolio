# About Me
Name: Aaryn Smith
Hometown: Tampa, FL
Prior IT Experience: I have hands-on experience working with a photobooth company, where I helped troubleshoot and maintain cameras, laptops, and printers. I made sure everything ran smoothly during events and enjoyed solving tech problems on the spot. I’m passionate about technology and like finding simple solutions to real-world issues.
Career Plans: I’m currently exploring different paths in cybersecurity and learning as much as I can. After completing the course, I hope to find a role where I can keep growing my skills and figure out what area of cybersecurity I enjoy most. I’m open to different industries and just excited to get started in the field.
Proud Project/Task: One experience I’m proud of is when I helped troubleshoot and fix equipment during a live event for the photobooth company I worked with. A printer stopped working right before guests arrived, and I had to quickly figure out the issue under pressure. I was able to get everything running in time, and the event went smoothly. It stands out to me because it showed me how much I enjoy solving problems and staying calm in high-pressure situations.
