# Information Security (InfoSec) — Core Concepts

This repository reflects my foundational understanding of Information Security (InfoSec) and how security principles are applied to protect data, systems, and organizations.

## What Is Information Security?
Information Security (InfoSec) focuses on protecting information so it remains:
- **Confidential** — accessible only to authorized users  
- **Integrity-Protected** — accurate and unaltered  
- **Available** — accessible when needed  

In simple terms, InfoSec is about preventing unauthorized access, tampering, or disruption of data and systems.

## The CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is the foundation of all security decision-making:

- **Confidentiality**  
  Enforced through access controls, encryption, and authentication to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

- **Integrity**  
  Maintained using checksums, digital signatures, hashing, and version control to prevent unauthorized changes.

- **Availability**  
  Ensured through redundancy, backups, monitoring, and disaster recovery planning.

## Non-Repudiation
Non-repudiation ensures accountability by preventing individuals from denying actions they performed.  
This is achieved through mechanisms such as digital signatures, audit logs, and encryption.

## Security Controls & Risk Mitigation
Security controls act as safeguards to reduce risk and are categorized by function:

- **Directive** — guide behavior (policies, standards)  
- **Deterrent** — discourage misuse (warning banners, monitoring)  
- **Compensating** — alternative controls when primary ones are not feasible  
- **Physical** — protect real-world assets (locks, cameras, badge access)

## Security Control Domains
Effective security relies on multiple control domains working together:

- **Technical** — firewalls, MFA, encryption, antivirus  
- **Managerial** — policies, governance, risk assessments  
- **Operational** — incident response, procedures, backups  
- **Physical** — facility and hardware protection  
- **Administrative** — people- and process-based controls

## Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Risk
- **Vulnerability** — a weakness in a system (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords)  
- **Threat** — anything that can exploit a vulnerability (e.g., attackers, malware, disasters)  
- **Risk** — the likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability  

Risk prioritization is based on both probability and business impact.

## Gap Analysis
Gap analysis identifies missing or insufficient security controls:

1. **Current State** — existing controls  
2. **Required State** — controls needed based on policies or frameworks  
3. **Gap** — what is missing or weak  

Frameworks such as **CIS Controls** or **CMMI** are commonly used to define baselines.

## AAA Framework
The AAA framework explains how access and accountability are managed:

- **Authentication** — verifies identity  
- **Authorization** — defines permitted actions  
- **Accounting** — logs and tracks user activity  

Authorization models and abstractions help reduce complexity and clearly map users to resources.

## Key Takeaway
Information Security is about managing risk—not just deploying tools.  
Strong security aligns **people, processes, and technology** to protect data while enabling business operations.
